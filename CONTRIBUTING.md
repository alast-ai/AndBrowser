# How to contribute
Hi! Thanks if you've decided to contribute to this project, that's actually something I never expected anyone to do.

## Submitting Changes
Send a [pull request to AndBrowser](https://github.com/saloonatic/AndBrowser/pull/new/master). Please make it clear what you've done.

Make sure to write a clear log message for your commits. Single-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should be multi-line.
```
    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > Add an optional extended description..."
```
